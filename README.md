# SMH.com.au-Command-Line-Interface
Who wouldn't want to read their newspaper from the comfort of their command line?

I built this on a lazy Sunday afternoon, in order to learn a little about the Python 'Curses' library. Built and tested on Mac OS X 10.11.

It's really simple to run:

1. Download the repo
2. Open a command line
3. CD into the project folder
4. Run "python SMH-CommandLine-Access.py".
5. Use the up and down arrows to select an article and press enter.
6. Use the up and down arrows to scroll through the article text
7. Press the "r" key to return back to the article menu.

Your mileage may vary.
